# DIY-Smart-LEDs
An arduino + windows project to control addressable led strips with ease

If your intent is to simply download and use, then you want to get the .ino sketch for the arduino and the App.zip folder. 
Install the FastLED library into your arduino IDE and upload the sketch. Make necessary adjustments to the sketch.
Open the .exe file within the App folder and you are ready to go!

For those of you interested in the code, then the Visual Studio folder contains all the resources you need to open the solution on MS visual studio. Feel free to modify the app to your liking.

Thanks for checking this project out! If you have any ideas for improvements or more features, let me know!
